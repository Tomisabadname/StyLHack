# How to install
Place the StyLHack.lua file in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\lua", Depending on what your drive letter is you may need to change it a bit!
Then open up a gmod game, and type "lua_openscript_cl StyLHack.lua" into your console!

Or if you are playing multiplayer, download a gmod bypass of the internet (i wont be providing one) and force sv_allowcslua 1, after that just run the script!
